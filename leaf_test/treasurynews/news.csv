"Washington – The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to analyze the exchange rate policies of other countries. Under Section 3004 of the Act, the Secretary must ""consider whether countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade.” Secretary Mnuchin, under the auspices of President Trump, has today determined that China is a Currency Manipulator.
As a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions.
As noted in the most recent Report to Congress on the Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States (“FX Report”), China has a long history of facilitating an undervalued currency through protracted, large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market. In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past. The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade.
The Chinese authorities have acknowledged that they have ample control over the RMB exchange rate. In a statement today, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) noted that it “has accumulated rich experience and policy tools, and will continue to innovate and enrich the control toolbox, and take necessary and targeted measures against the positive feedback behavior that may occur in the foreign exchange market.” This is an open acknowledgement by the PBOC that it has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis.
This pattern of actions is also a violation of China’s G20 commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation.  As highlighted in the FX Report, Treasury places significant importance on China adhering to its G-20 commitments to refrain from engaging in competitive devaluation and to not target China’s exchange rate for competitive purposes. Treasury continues to urge China to enhance the transparency of China’s exchange rate and reserve management operations and goals.

"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating China-based Shanghai Saint Logistics Limited for acting as a general sales agent (GSA) for or on behalf of Iranian airline Mahan Air. This is the seventh designation of a GSA to Mahan Air since 2018. Mahan Air is designated under counterterrorism authorities for providing support to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), as well as under a counter proliferation authority that targets weapons of mass destruction proliferators and their supporters.
“The Iranian regime is using Mahan Air to support an illegitimate and corrupt regime in Venezuela, just as it has done for the regime in Syria and for terrorist proxy groups throughout the Middle East,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “We will not hesitate to target those entities that continue to maintain commercial relationships with Mahan Air.”
For years, Mahan Air flights have transported terrorists and lethal cargo throughout the Middle East, including to Syria to prop up the murderous Assad regime. Mahan Air is currently operating charter flights to Venezuela for Iranian technicians and technical equipment, using materials sourced from China. This scheme supports the illegitimate Maduro regime’s efforts to revive its energy production, languished by its corruption and mismanagement. The Government of Venezuela is reportedly paying for this support with gold bars directly from the Central Bank of Venezuela — gold that belongs to the Venezuelan people.
Mahan Air was designated in October 2011 pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224 for providing financial, material, or technological support for or to the IRGC-QF. Mahan Air has transported IRGC-QF operatives, weapons, equipment, and funds abroad in support of the IRGC-QF’s regional operations and has also moved weapons and personnel for Hizballah. Since the onset of the Syrian civil war, Mahan Air has routinely flown fighters and materiel to Syria to prop up the Assad regime, which has contributed to the regime’s atrocities and displacement of civilians. In December 2019, the Department of State designated Mahan Air pursuant to E.O. 13382, a counter proliferation authority targeting weapons of mass destruction proliferators and their supporters.
Shanghai Saint Logistics Limited is Mahan Air’s cargo GSA in Shanghai, providing services such as freight booking for Mahan Air flights between China and Iran. GSAs are third parties that provide services to an airline. These services range from sales, financial, administrative, and marketing support to freight reception and handling.
Shanghai Saint Logistics Limited is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Mahan Air.
Today’s action marks OFAC’s seventh designation of a Mahan Air GSA, following previous designations in 2018 and 2019, and provides another warning to the international aviation community of the sanctions risk for individuals and entities that choose to maintain commercial relationships with Mahan Air and other designated airlines. Those in the airline industry should conduct due diligence to avoid performing services, including GSA services, for or on behalf of a designated person, which may be sanctionable. Such activities may include freight booking, reservation and ticketing services, procurement of aircraft parts and equipment, maintenance contracts, airline grounds services, catering, interline transfer or codeshare agreements, and refueling contracts.
On July 23, 2019, OFAC issued an advisory to inform the civil aviation industry of potential exposure to U.S. government economic sanctions for providing unauthorized support to or for designated Iranian airlines, many of which, including Mahan Air, are involved in facilitating the Iranian regime’s support to proxy militias and groups it supports.
As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of Shanghai Saint Logistics Limited that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealing by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve property or interest in property of blocked or designated persons.
In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with Shanghai Saint Logistics Limited may themselves be exposed to designation. Furthermore, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant transaction or provides significant financial services for individuals and entities designated in connection with Iran’s support for international terrorism or any Iranian person on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons could be subject to U.S. correspondent account or payable-through account sanctions.

"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced North Korea-related designations, continuing the implementation of existing sanctions.  Today’s action against two entities and one individual targets the revenue North Korea earns from overseas information technology (IT) workers. 
“These actions are intended to stop the flow of illicit revenue to North Korea from overseas information technology workers disguising their true identities and hiding behind front companies, aliases, and third-party nationals.  Treasury is once again warning the IT industry, businesses, and individuals across the globe to take precautions to ensure that they are not unwittingly employing North Korean workers for technology projects by doing business with companies like the ones designated today,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  “The United States will continue to fully enforce and implement sanctions until we have achieved the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.”
OFAC designated Jilin, China-based Yanbian Silverstar Network Technology Co., Ltd. (a.k.a. “China Silver Star” or 延边银星网络科技有限公司), its North Korean CEO, Jong Song Hwa (정성화), and its Vladivostok, Russia-based sister company, Volasys Silver Star. 
China Silver Star is nominally a Chinese IT company, but in reality it is managed and controlled by North Koreans.  As of mid-2018, China Silver Star had earned millions of dollars from collaborative projects with Chinese and other companies.  In early 2017, a North Korean IT worker and employee of China Silver Star created Volasys Silver Star as a Russia-based front company, most likely to facilitate the circumvention of identification requirements on freelance job fora and obfuscate the North Korean workers’ true nationality from clients.  In early 2018, Volasys Silver Star employees, many of whom had moved to Russia from China Silver Star, had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in under a year.  Although nominally run by a Russian individual, Volasys Silver Star is also in fact managed by North Koreans.  As its CEO, Jong Song Hwa set company goals for China Silver Star, and he controls the flow of earnings for several teams of developers in China and Russia. 
China Silver Star and Volasys Silver Star were each designated under two authorities:  for having engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for the exportation of workers from North Korea, including exportation to generate revenue for the Government of North Korea or the Workers’ Party of Korea (E.O. 13722); and for operating in the IT industry in North Korea (E.O. 13810).  Jong Song Hwa was designated for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, China Silver Star. 
The United Nations Security Council acknowledged in Resolution 2397 of 2017 that the revenue generated from North Korean workers overseas contributes to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.  Indeed, China Silver Star is associated with the UN- and U.S.-designated Munitions Industry Department (MID) of the Workers’ Part of Korea and the UN- and U.S.-designated Korea Kuryonggang Trading Corporation (Kuryonggang).  The MID is responsible for overseeing North Korea’s ballistic missile programs, and Kuryonggang is primarily responsible for the procurement of commodities and technologies to support North Korea’s defense research and development programs and procurement. 
As a result of today’s action, any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within the United States must be blocked, and U.S. persons generally are prohibited from dealing with any of the designated persons.
Furthermore, as noted in the recent Supply Chain Advisory issued by the U.S. Department of State, with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the IT industry, among other industries, has heightened risk of involving North Korean labor.  North Korea sells a range of IT services and products abroad, including website and app development, security software, and biometric identification software that have military and law enforcement applications.  North Korean firms disguise themselves through a variety of tactics including the use of front companies, aliases, and third-country nationals who act as facilitators.  Businesses should be aware of deceptive practices employed by North Korea in order to implement effective due diligence policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements across their entire supply chains.

"Washington – U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today on the Presidential Memorandum on China’s unfair trade practices:
“There is a shared recognition between China and the United States that our two countries must adjust the balance in our trade relationship, including addressing the trade deficit. We will continue to engage in discussions to meet these goals.
“However, China’s discriminatory and unfair trade and investment practices are aimed squarely at, and detrimental to, the United States. China has sought to gain access to intellectual property and cutting-edge technology developed by U.S. businesses through such wrongful practices as systemic, government-driven investment in U.S. companies, unreasonable requirements and limiting restrictions intended to pressure U.S. firms, and cyber-enabled intrusions. This conduct threatens our national interests, undermines the value of U.S. investments and technology, weakens the global competitiveness of our firms, and harms American workers. Today’s actions are designed to counter this conduct and address the threat it presents to U.S. national interests. 
“We support free, fair, and reciprocal trading relationships. The United States offers the biggest consumer market and among the most generous trading terms. We now need better and more balanced trade in return.”

"Action reflects concern with Iran's continued development of ballistic missiles
Washington – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated seven targets in connection with Iran's ballistic missile program.  OFAC designated two senior Iranian defense officials, including a defense official who facilitated the sale of explosives and provided other support to Syria and the director of the organization responsible for Iran's solid-fueled ballistic missile program.  In addition, OFAC designated a China-based network that is supporting Iran's military by supplying millions of dollars' worth of missile-applicable items and an Iran-based entity that is assisting Iran's ballistic missile program.  Today's actions were taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and supporters of such activity.  These sanctions underscore the United States' concern with Iran's continued development and testing of ballistic missiles. 
""This Administration is committed to countering Iran's destabilizing behavior, such as Iran's development of ballistic missiles and support to the Assad regime.  It is alarming that individuals involved with Iran's missile program are assisting the brutal Assad regime, and we are taking action to curtail this behavior,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. ""These sanctions target Iranian officials as well as a China-based network that are providing support to Syria and supplying items to further Iran's ballistic weapons program.  The United States will remain vigilant when it comes to Iran.""
OFAC took today's action in conjunction with the State Department's release of its semi-annual report to Congress detailing sanctions imposed on persons responsible for or complicit in human rights abuses committed against citizens of Iran or their family members. Report pursuant to the comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010
Morteza Farasatpour and Rahim Ahmadi 
OFAC sanctioned Morteza Farasatpour, a senior Iranian defense official, for his activities on behalf of a designated Iranian defense entity.  Farasatpour was designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Iran's Defense Industries Organization (DIO).  DIO was designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 on March 30, 2007, for engaging in activities that have materially contributed to the development of Iran's nuclear and missile programs. 
Farasatpour coordinated the sale and delivery of explosives and other materiel for Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) on behalf of DIO.  As DIO's Deputy Director for Commerce, Farasatpour oversaw DIO's credit line with the SSRC, which was valued at tens of millions of dollars.  The SSRC was listed in the Annex to E.O.  13382 on June 28, 2005, and is the Syrian entity responsible for developing and producing non-conventional weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
OFAC also sanctioned Rahim Ahmadi, a senior Iranian official serving as the Director of Iran's Shahid Bakeri Industries Group (SBIG) for his involvement in Iran's ballistic missile program.  SBIG was listed in the Annex to E.O. 13382 on June 28, 2005, and is responsible for Iran's solid-fueled ballistic missile program.  Ahmadi was designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, SBIG.

Ruan Runling Network
OFAC designated Chinese national Ruan Runling and three associated Chinese companies for proliferation activities in support of a key designated Iranian defense entity.  Ruan was sanctioned pursuant to E.O. 13382 because he has provided, or attempted to provide, financial, material, technological, or other support for, or goods or services in support of Iran's Shiraz Electronics Industries (SEI).  OFAC designated SEI on September 17, 2008, for being owned or controlled by Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, which was designated on October 25, 2007.  SEI has engaged in the production of various electronics equipment for the Iranian military, including missile guidance technology.
Ruan is a Chinese proliferation agent and has supplied SEI with missile-applicable items and technology, to include U.S.-origin goods.  Since at least 2015, Ruan has provided SEI with a wide range of missile-related technology and goods that include gyroscopes and other missile-applicable navigation technology.  Gyroscopes can be used in missile systems for navigational, guidance, or stabilization purposes.
As part of today's action, OFAC designated three China-based companies associated with Ruan.  Shanghai North Begins International, Shangai Gang Quan Trade Co., and Shanghai North Transway International Trading Co. are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 for having provided, or attempted to provide, financial, material, technological, or other support for, or goods or services in support of, SEI.  Ruan used Shanghai North Begins International to sell $17 million worth of navigation-applicable technology and guidance systems, as well as other dual-use technology to SEI.  Ruan, via Shangai Gang Quan Trade, sold goods to SEI.  Ruan also used Shanghai North Transway to sell more than $1 million worth of items to SEI.
